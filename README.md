# Predict Metal Or Rock Object From Sonar Return Dataset

### Problem Statement
The problem is to predict
metal or rock objects from sonar return data. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range
0.0 to 1.0. Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated
over a certain period of time. The label associated with each record contains the letter R if
the object is a rock and M if it is a mine (metal cylinder).

### Data Set description :
The numbers in the features are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the angle directly.
